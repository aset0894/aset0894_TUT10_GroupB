# aset0894_TUT10_GroupB Prototype

## Instructions
There is no user input needed to interact with the prototype. Basically, after loading the page, the user just needs to wait for approximately 3 seconds and it will automatically switch the state to the dark mode with the perlin-noise-colored grid.

## Details of the individual prototype
I chose Perlin noise to modify the group initial code and produce the individual prototype. My focus is on the color-changing grid lines using noise and mapping the noise to create a smooth colour-changing effect on the grid line.

### 1. The features
The following features make the prototype unique compared to other group membersâ€™s individual prototypes with different focuses: Although it still retains the structure of the group code, there are some changes applied as well.

#### Automatic mode switching (light mode and dark mode)

To still retain the original colour scheme of the artwork but also show the perlin-noise modification in a fun way, I applied two modes that are continuously switching. The light mode depicts the original colour scheme of the artwork, which is the default state, while the dark mode depicts the perlin-noise modification.

#### Interaction with the character

The colour-changing does not only occur automatically with time; it also involves interaction with the character blocks. The character colliding with the grid line will trigger the colour-changing effect on the grid.

### 2. Reference or Inspiration
The inspiration for this prototype comes from the dark mode and light mode that are usually used in a game.
